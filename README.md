## Design ideology

Most of the features were developed to include possible new features without changing the existing code. The needed
maintenance was supposed to stay low.

## Usage

The cheat does not modify any minecraft elements, every new widget is in the iconic panel style:

![](media/Button%20showcase.png)

### Account manager

The account manager splits logging in and updating the session.  
Don't forget to set your session after logging in.

### Panel screen

The panel screen is bound to `right-shift` by default. This can be changed however.  
Panels are clamped into the visible viewport.

#### Configuring panels

Panels can be middle-clicked on the title bar, which will open a menu with all its values.  
If it doesn't, the panel does not have any values.

#### Key binds

- Using the `alt` key, you can align panels with each other
- Using the `shift` key, you can make sliders ignore their min and max boundaries
- Using the `arrow` keys, you can adjust hovered sliders in small steps. (The handle which you are changing on range
  sliders is the side the mouse is on)
- Using the `ctrl+v` shortcut in text field screens, will automatically fill in the clipboard content into the text
  fields, as long as no text field is focused and the clipboard content is in the common colon-separated format

### Modules

Most modules have values, make sure to check if you configured a module according to your needs.

#### ESP

The shader esp uses the minecraft spectral arrow esp.  
An optional texture pack, which can be found in the run folder of this repository, can improve its looks.  
This decision was made in order to allow compatibility with other mods, which modify the entity rendering.

### Package system

Packages either add more features, add support or do other miscellaneous changes to the game, which aren't important
enough to belong to the main mod.  
To install a package drop it into your mods folder like any other fabric mod.

### File management and values

Location:

- `%userprofile%/tarasande` on Windows
- `~/tarasande` on Linux

The cheat does create backups and labels them `[filename]_Backup`. These files might come in handy whenever you or the
cheat messed up.

Values are the way the cheat saves your configuration.  
To share your configuration, you need to send the Values file.

### Support

Windows and Linux are supported. I do not own MacOS hardware, so there is no official support for it. Launching the
cheat under MacOS shouldn't pose much of a challenge, however.

## Download

I am not offering binary downloads. You can compile it yourself, trust me.

Download the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Sumandora/tarasande.git`  
Updates can be downloaded by running `git pull` in the cloned repository.

### IDEs

Opening the repository using an IDE is possible and recommended for development, the following instructions will only
show how to compile/run the cheat with a command-line/terminal.

### Compile from source

Building requires JDK17.

- On Windows, run `gradlew build`
- On Linux, run `./gradlew build`

This will compile the base cheat with all packages.  
You can find the base cheat in the `build/libs` folder.

### Running from source

Running requires JDK17.

First you have to generate the source code

- On Windows, run `gradlew :genSources`
- On Linux, run `./gradlew :genSources`

After that run:

- On Windows, run `gradlew :runClient`
- On Linux, run `./gradlew :runClient`

This will run the base cheat in a development environment.  
Your working directory will be the run folder in the repository root.

### Installing the packages

Run the following command if you didn't do it already.

- On Windows, run `gradlew build`
- On Linux, run `./gradlew build`

If you are running the cheat in a dev environment run:

- On Windows, run `gradlew installPackages`
- On Linux, run `./gradlew installPackages`

You can now start the cheat again and will have all packages installed.

If you are not running a dev environment enter the package folder you want.  
Enter the `build/libs` folder of the package folder and move the main jar file to your mods folder.  
The "main" jar file is the one without any suffix other than the version.

Also note that the rendering code is largely inefficient and was made to be easy not fast.

## Accomplishments

- This cheat managed to get to the top of Hypixels Sumo PvP leaderboard.
- This cheat beat several other cheats (some with prices of up to 100â‚¬), while the cheaters usually don't even see that
  they were killed by a cheat.
- Bypassed killaura checks of anticheats with many years work put into them.
- The cheat was used as a ghost cheat in many high-rank games. Many modules were used (e.g. Kill aura and Scaffold
  walk) but the cheating went unnoticed for months and years.
